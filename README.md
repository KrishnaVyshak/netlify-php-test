# netlify-php-test

Simple PHP page that is renderable statically.  
Minor javascript usage for comparison's sake of what is frozen in time at deploy vs what is possible dynamically (via javascript rather than php!)

Build command in netlify:

[./mybuild.sh](https://github.com/fool/netlify-php-test/blob/master/mybuild.sh)
